# TimeRangeExpertAdvisorVerson1.1

The EA finds the high and low from a specified time range, whenever the price breaks
the high/low a trade is enterd with a stop loss at high/low.                                
Closes all trades at specified time.

V1.1 Changes the logic to trade a stop run before the entry, 
meaning that to short the high needs to be taken before the low and entry
stop loss at the high.
