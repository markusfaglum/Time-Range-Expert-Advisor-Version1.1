The EA identifies the high and low within a specified time range. When the price breaks either the high or low, a trade is initiated with a stop loss placed at the respective high or low. All trades are closed at a predetermined time.

Version 1.1 introduces a change in logic, where a stop run is required before the entry. To initiate a short trade, the high must be taken out before the low, with the stop loss placed at the high.
